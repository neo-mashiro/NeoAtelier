# Atelier Mana Oasis

Welcome to Atelier Mana Oasis! This is the workshop where project __Mana-Oasis__ will come to life.

## Build

```bash
source setup.sh
```
This will create the virtual environment and install all necessary packages.


If you want to locally build the documentation in html format, just run the following (after `source setup.sh`) and it will be built in docs/book.
```bash
source docs.sh
```

## TODO
