# Atelier Mana Oasis

Welcome to Atelier Mana Oasis! This is the workshop where project __Mana-Oasis__ will come to life.

## Build the docs

For the initial one-time setup, run the `setup.sh` script to create the virtual environment and install all necessary packages.
```bash
./setup.sh
```

If you want to locally build the documentation in HTML format, run
```bash
source docs.sh
```
