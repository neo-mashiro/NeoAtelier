??? key "Background"

    === "Introduce yourself"

        Tell me about yourself and your background? (5-6 minutes)

        > Hey there! My name is WL, I'm a software engineer with `x` years of experience. I used to work in other industries, then transitioned to VFX in 2022.

        > Coming off high school, I was studying mathematics and economics at SHUFE for my undergraduate degree. Right after graduation, I went to TAMU to study statistics and earned my M.Sc in econometrics. Back when I was in school, I was never the smartest guy in the room but I was definitely a good student, my parents and teachers were always like “Just focus on your studies, do well in exams, get into a high-ranked university, and land a job at a big company that pays well. That's how you start your life on the right foot”. When I was an undergraduate student in 2008, my major was actually a hot topic. So, math, statistics, combined with economics and finance, people believe that knowing these can make you a lot of money, while I was not sure if that’s gonna make money, I do love the math equations and models in the textbook, so I naively adopted other people's beliefs as my own source of truth. I remember around 2008, most people in China had no idea what an iPhone is, what Google is, nobody was talking about AI, C++11 hasn’t come out yet, even Python 2.7 has not been released yet, so computer science wasn’t really on my radar, because of that, I never thought about learning programming.

        > Fast forward to 2012-2014, I was 24 years old living in Texas. I had spent over 6 years studying math, statistics, and finance, and had tried all sorts of part-time jobs like being a waiter, cashier, and delivery driver. Despite all this, I still couldn't figure out what I wanted to do as a career. I felt completely lost and was just blindly following other people's advice. Well one thing I did know is that I love Japanese anime and manga, I've been watching anime since I was a kid and have always been enjoying it. But, that has nothing to do with my career because, even today, most anime sequences are drawn by hand, and I know nothing about painting. After graduation, I went back home to China, and I got two job offers, one was from Manulife, that Canadian insurance company that also has an overseas branch in Shanghai, the other one was from a big real-estate company in Japan, both offered me a similar role related to finance. Since I love Japanese culture and I speak Japanese, I decided to challenge myself by relocating to Tokyo. So that was my first full-time job, I was a financial advisor who provides financial advice to foreign investors looking to do investment in Japan, mostly in commercial properties and land properties, but I also do a few residential properties as well.

        > Just a few months later, I realized that I didn't really like the job, and that Japan is not as beautiful as romantic as in the animations, so I was quite disappointed. It was a very tough period in my life, the culture in that industry in Japan was kind of toxic at the time, I had to work over 14 hours a day, 28 days a month, I’m serious, not joking, everyday I felt exhausted and totally stressed out, and even closing transactions couldn’t give me a sense of accomplishment. Well, to be honest, it’s actually a quite good job, at least in that industry, the job application process was very competitive, and I have to admit that the pay was really good, almost the best you could expect as a new graduate. However on the flip side, it relies heavily on building social networks. I’m not talking about relationships with colleagues or customers, but more about making connections with other people/agencies across the industry, that’s how to become the first one to receive great offers that’s not even made public yet, that’s how to get insider information. You need to know all kinds of people from banks, from the government, because you often need to bring a draft floor/building plan to the public office to check if they comply with the building code, things like that. For people who love it, it’s definitely a great job, but I’m just not that good at building social relationships, and I don’t want to keep doing it for the rest of my life. Anyway, I could have a lot more excuses, but the main thing is that, I realized I prefer to do something more technical, I’m always more interested in the technical side of things. So, after a whole year of hesitation, I decided to quit the job, and I went back to China, became unemployed.

        > At the time, I felt like a complete loser, like an underdog, because nobody around me had left their first job so quickly, and I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, even if I knew I wanted to do something technical and creative. Then I remembered during my interview with Manulife last year, they mentioned that they wanted to hire more actuaries. Since I have passed four ASA (Associate of the Society of Actuaries) exams during my graduate studies, and I have built a really good relationship with the recruiter during the 7 rounds of interviews last year, so even if I previously turned down their offer, I thought it might be worth reaching out again. So, I contacted that recruiter to see if they were still hiring, and we had a good conversation. He told me that they were no longer hiring actuaries, but the IT department was looking for people to work on their new bank insurance projects, so he asked if I have interest in coding. At first I was like, no way, I’ve never done any coding before and I know nothing about programming, But he mentioned that my background in math and statistics is a big plus, I have the domain knowledge of insurance and finance, and it’s also easier for him to do less paperwork since I already went through all the previous rounds of interviews. He said, all I have to do is to learn a bit of C# and PL/SQL (Procedural Language for SQL), and then he would arrange for me to meet with the IT team. He also mentioned that actuaries these days have a high turnover rate because companies are starting to use R and Python instead of MS Excel or SAS, so even if I were to work in the actuarial department, I would still need to learn programming from scratch. It was a casual talk, so he also told me some stories, he said that many actuaries, after learning to code, were leaving the industry to do machine learning instead because that makes a lot more money, and I was like, what is machine learning, that’s a whole new buzzword to me, how is it possible that machines can learn? So after the phone call, I did some research online, I learned that CS and DS is a big trend in the tech world now. This was all happening in 2016, in China to be specific, where more and more people were starting to talk about facial recognition, deep learning, computer vision, etc. It was not 2008 anymore, it was 2016, so most people knew the Google search engine even if it’s banned in China, more people were using Apple products like iPhones and iPads, those are no longer reserved for the rich people, and most importantly, computer science had become the most popular major that everyone wanted to study in university.

        > So, I started learning C# and PL/SQL from scratch, and a few weeks later I joined Manulife as a database engineer in the IT department, developing database applications, that’s how I made a career transition into the programming world in 2016. Since 2017, I began to delve deeper into computer science in my spare time, I explored everything from Python, C++, operating systems, algorithms and data structures, all the way to data science and computer vision, but because I was mostly watching free open courses online from some English-speaking universities, that only scratched the surface of each topic but failed to go in more depth. Around that same time, I made a big decision in my life to study abroad again to pursue another M.Sc in CS, I believed that would lead to better job opportunities and eventually help me immigrate. I knew the tuition fees are very expensive in the states and it’s hard to obtain H1B visas these days, so I gave up the universities in the U.S and turned to look at Australia and Canada because of their friendly immigration policies, and then I also gave up Australia when people told me that the giant spiders is a big deal there. After working at Manulife for 3.5 years, I’ve saved up enough money to cover my graduate study’s cost, I’ve also completed a few side projects and over 40 courses on Coursera. Those credits are not official so they don’t really count towards an academic degree, but some professors still highly appreciate that, so one of the professors I talked to, named Stefan Bruda, he decided to give me a chance to study in their computer science master’s program, at BU in Quebec. So on Christmas in 2019, I stepped onto my journey to Canada.

        > During the two years 2020 and 2021 in Quebec, I was concentrated on my study in computer science. But because the scope of computer science is way too broad, there are so many things under this umbrella, I was still pretty lost in choosing the right career. Initially I was deeply into socket programming for a course on computer networks, then I got interested in medical imaging analysis where you have a 3D medical image of the brain scanned from MRI or f-MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and you need to convert these voxels into a sequence of 2D images, then you can write a program using NumPy, Pandas and matplotlib, doing image registration, image segmentation, then denoise it, and finally analyze the data on the screen. That is essentially an application of computer vision and some math, but the last part is visualization, and that really changed everything. So, for my final project, my professor asked me to visualize the 3D neuro image in the viewport in the Unity game engine, that’s when I learned a new word called computer graphics, and all of a sudden I was like, this is exactly what I want to do in my life, using technology to build creative arts? that’s just amazing! So after that, I dedicated all my time to learning CG, I delved into game development in Unity, learned C++ and OpenGL, and I even spent a whole 7 months building a physically-based renderer in OpenGL. This project serves both as an exercise and a portfolio for job applications.

        > I started job hunting in June 2022, and soon after that I had the chance to talk to Steve about the lighting TD role, that’s how I got my foot into the door of the VFX industry. To be honest, I had never heard of the term VFX before applying for this job. I’m not a big fan of watching movies, the only thing I watch is Japanese animation, so my understanding of computer graphics was really confined to the game industry, Unity and Unreal engine, plus a few architectural visualization companies like IKEA. So when I joined AL two years ago, I was a new graduate who knows nothing about this industry, with absolutely 0 experience. Even today, I’m still a beginner in terms of knowledge and experience, there are always so many things to learn, so many new technologies coming out each year. I just really appreciate that AL gave me this opportunity to work here, I’m really grateful to Luke and Jo Ann for kindly recommending me to Steve, which gave me the chance to discuss this role. So yeah it’s just a job, but it also means a lot to me. It took me 10 years to figure out a career that’s right for me, a career that I’m passionate about. I know I’m really late to the party, but I just want to keep working in this industry, to hone my technical skills. I do believe that VFX is the real application of computer graphics, this is the real 3D industry, we spend tons of money to make a good film, we don’t compromise on the model details, on surfacing, animation, visual effects, hair and furs, we care about every single pixel in every frame, we aim to produce images of the best quality to tell the story, so I’m really amazed at what we are doing, and I believe OpenUSD is the future of 3D. So yeah, that’s basically how I ended up here.

    === "Why interested ?"

        Why are you interested in our company and in this role? (3-4 minutes)

        > ......

    === "Work in Japan"

        How much was the Japanese company paying?

        > Converted to Canadian dollars, I think it’s close to 60 grand, that’s the base salary, plus you also have bonuses from being able to close transactions, which can be huge. For some veterans who knows a lot of people in the industry, they just need a single transaction to be done for the year. That could be a huge land property, or buying and selling an entire commercial office building. So even if you are acting as a broker instead of a buyer and seller who takes advantage of that arbitrage, you can still get 3% for the transaction fees and that could be huge. Well technically, 3% is the profit that goes into the company’s bank account, not your own pocket, your bonus can be 5%, 10% or 20% out of that 3% depending on some other factors.

        What were you exactly doing in Japan?

        > As I mentioned, my job was to provide financial advice to foreign investors who have interest in investment in Japan. It could be just a residential property investment for individual investors, but often times the investors are going to be a group of people from HK and TW, you know there are a lot of rich people there, that’s why they hired me because I can speak Mandarin to those people. Sometimes it could also be a foreign company that wants to buy or rent an office building, or a warehouse for production, or even a soap land (the equivalent of strip clubs in the North America), that’s not on the list of my job duties as a junior, but yeah some senior people were doing it.

        > Speaking of the things I did:

        > - New properties will be released onto an industry-private website on a daily basis, the website (REINS) is managed by a public organization in the government, it’s not public to people outside the industry. Every week, I need to select some of these and visit on site, and then write up a report template with analysis of each property.
        > - During that process, I might need to collect some observations and data around the site, exchange some private market data with other companies and local agencies. That’s not just how you share info with others, but also how you retrieve info from others, how you find local deals that’s not on the internet. If I know I have a great deal on a property, for example a property that’s owned by our company and we want other agencies to help us sell it in their neighborhood, then unless this person has a really good relationship with me in the past, I don’t want to disclose this to him.
        > - Our industry has a strong focus on human networks and relationships, and also, the national Japanese culture is very serious about delivering the best quality of customer service they can offer, regardless of industry. So for those reasons, the business is primarily driven by people, although we have plenty of data-driven approaches and theories written in the textbook, in practice they simply don’t apply, or it’s way too expensive to apply just for a hypothetical profit that’s not even guaranteed.
        > - Things have changed a lot since the first Airbnb was introduced in Japan in 2017, I’ve heard that some companies were shifting towards that market in Japan, and people were talking more about hotels and concept of real estate digitalization, but I left Japan in 2016 so I don’t know too much about that.

        > In case you are curious about where those investors come from, they are usually recommended by other agency brokers from China, from brokers that have a long-standing relationship with us. For asset investments like this, every time you make a transaction, it’s never going to be just one or two brokers sitting in the middle. When investors ask for a specific kind of property, first they need to find a local agency broker in China in order to reach us. Even then, in our inventory, we probably don’t have exactly what they want, so we still need to search for such a property in the market by visiting local agencies, or checking the resources we have from others. If you are not fast enough, or if you are not well-prepared ahead of time, you’re likely going to lose that investor that customer.

    === "Work at Manulife"

        What were you exactly doing at Manulife?

        > We develop applications based on the Oracle database, there’s really nothing interesting about that. For me, we only have 3 people in our team, and we basically just develop a transaction system for the bank insurance. So a customer walks into a local branch of the bank, he wants to buy our insurance through our bank partner so he’s going to initiate a transaction request from the bank side. The bank staff will ask him to fill in some personal information, answer a few questions, and then submit the request from their central system. The request will be encrypted into an XML, which goes through the network to reach our Apache Tomcat server. Then we deserialize the XML, put them into a message queue, write the data into a table. There’s going to be a scheduled batch job that runs every couple of seconds to detect if we have any pending request to be handled (the batch job is a .bat file on Windows that’s registered on our server). And finally, the data gets fed into our transaction system entry point, we need to validate the data, run a whole bunch of rules, determine the eligibility of both the applicant and the insurer. If everything works fine, we are gonna invoke the core API to issue a new policy, generate a list of PDF reports, assemble a response XML and send it back to the bank, otherwise we abort the transaction and ask the customer to try again.

        > You know, this is just a overly simplified view of our transaction pipeline, everything is going paperless and electronic these days, so we usually have a separate child application at each stage of the pipeline. Also in practice, there are many more types of transactions like filing a claim or a change request. There’s also lots of regulations in the industry, and we have our own rules as an insurance company, each bank also has their own set of rules. We have partnership with many different banks, from all over the world, not just one. Every bank may have a transaction that looks very different, they might have special laws and regulations in the local region, so for each bank channel, we need to create a new database schema to develop the transaction system, but all of those schemas need to inherit from a generalized core schema.

        > Anyway, the system architecture can be quite complicated in terms of software engineering design patterns and design principles, but the code itself is just all about business logic, not much innovative technology, so nothing interesting about that. However, you do need to have a solid understanding of the domain knowledge, not just about insurance, but also some finance, because many companies these days have products that pay dividends, accumulate cash value and annuities, some of them also offer the option to invest the cash value into stocks and bonds. So as a policyholder, you are no longer buying a traditional life insurance, it’s more like a type of investment.

        > If you are working as a developer in the financial industry, most likely they are gonna prioritize security and correctness as the top thing to keep in mind, not performance, not usability, not creativeness, but more about security and correctness. Every number you see is going to be the dollar value appeared in someone’s account, so we really cannot afford to make even a small mistake. For this reason, the testing phase usually takes a lot longer than the development phase, we have unit tests, SIT, UAT, stress test, and finally we need people to be physically present at the bank and do testing there on site. Only after that we can release into production.

        > Yes we also do on-call on a rotating basis. Every couple of weeks, it’s going to be your turn to stay in the office overnight, on the grand release day. In financial institutions, changes are usually only released weekly or monthly on a specific release day. You need to wait until the bank server is shut down at 11 PM, only then you can release all the changes into the production database. Imagine that you have 200 tickets to release on that day, and there are lots of dependencies between them so you need to make sure everything is released in the right order. As a dev you don’t usually need to do these, because that’s the job duties of a DBA (Database Administrator), but if something goes wrong during the release, he is not able to handle that since he’s not the person who writes the code, so that’s why you need to be there, you need to quickly figure out what’s going on, find out which ticket which package is the problem, who made that change, and then comes the best part, which is that you need to call this person to wake him up at 3 AM, ask him to fix the problem asap, otherwise it’s going to be a production accident. No matter what happens, everything must be sorted out before 6 AM in the morning, because the bank server will start up at 7 AM.

    === "Work at Netflix"

        What were you exactly doing at FAN?

        > At AL, initially I was actually applying for the software engineer position in the rendering team. You know, I have this beautiful C++ portfolio which is a real-time physically-based renderer, that really caught their eyes. So I was talking to Luke during the first round of interview, he’s the engineering manager of the rendering team. We talked a bit about some basic rendering stuff like light sampling, SSS, indirect lighting, hairs and furs, and then we both realized I was probably not a good fit for the role. You know, because my renderer is real-time in OpenGL, it’s based on rasterization, so it doesn’t really have much indirect lighting other than some light maps and IBL. It’s not like a real path tracer where you trace rays from camera into the scene, and then have it bounce around to calculate the light contribution at each shading point, so my renderer is missing a lot of key features he’s looking for such as volumes, indirect, motion blur. I also didn’t have much C++ programming skills that’s performance-oriented like the use of advanced multithreading, so the conversation really just ended there. But luckily for me, the recruiter and him didn’t give up on me, they recommended me to Steve who’s in charge of the lighting TD’s team. Then we had a great conversation in the next 3 rounds of interviews, and later I joined AL as a lighting TD in August 2022.

        > Basically as a lighting TD, my job is to create all kinds of tools for lighting artists, to help them do lighting on the shots. If the renderer failed for some reason, or if the program crashed, we need to debug our tools see if there’s anything not working, or maybe find an evidence that the render was at fault and submit bug reports to the rendering team. If the render doesn’t look good, or if the render time or memory usage is too high, we also need to find the culprit, maybe help the artists optimize their light rigs, the render settings, or some heavy procedurals like furs and weaves. At AL, what makes our lighting TDs different from other TDs is our in-house lighting software called Filament. We don’t use Katana or Gaffer for lighting, we develop and maintain our own lighting software which is Filament. Filament is a PyQt application that’s entirely built on USD, we have many different components in the app, such as a node-based graph editor for authoring light rigs, a stage outliner for viewing and editing prims, a properties view, an interactive render plugin for doing local IPR renders, and a real-time interactive viewport. ……

    === "Related Q&A"

        Why not pursue a career in quants?

        > Quant is definitely a great job, one of the best-paid jobs in the market. You know, all of my friends, my classmates in school, they are all working in the financial industry, in banks, in security firms, working on private equity, or mutual funds, and I can keep talking about this for hours. However, this is a highly technical and competitive position, very much like being an actuary, it’s not enough to just know about the interest rate model, the put-call parity, you know, the math behind derivative pricing like options, futures and annuities, but there’s also a strong focus on algorithmic programming, so you need to write highly-performant C++ code in order to find potential arbitrage opportunities, which is quite hard.

        > In fact, the financial industry can vary wildly from country to country. In China, our market is still quite young compared to those in the U.S or Europe, there aren’t many established firms with robust quant teams, but that’s not even the main thing. The main thing is that, because of some culture differences, our market in China still places a higher value on traditional methods and human relationships, it’s not a free market where the prices of goods are always determined by demand and supply, so a lot of data-driven approaches and quant strategies simply do not apply there. You might have heard that China's regulatory environment is very restrictive, which is largely true. I’m not going to talk about the bureaucracy and drinking culture, but we do have very strict regulations on securities, insurance and banks for all kinds of reasons, you don’t always need people who are technical because tech is not always that important, but you definitely need people who have a broad human network and resources across the industry, especially those who can potentially bring insider information to the table. This issue is not just about the financial industry, we also have strict censorship on the game industry for example, any kind of violence content in game is considered a law violation, and there’s a list of rules to help prevent game addiction, also any AI stuff like Gemini and ChatGPT are strictly banned.

        > Anyway, I know I have an immigration plan to eventually work and live in Canada, so working hard to become a quant at that time was never an option for me.


??? key "General"

    === "Why U ?"

        Why should we hire you? What can you bring to the table?

        > Coding skills, graphics and rendering, portfolio, C++ debugging and optimization...

        > I think the job qualifications pretty much align with my skill set, so I believe I can quickly adapt myself to this environment and become a successful candidate.

    === "Vision yourself"

        Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

        > I think 5 years is too long because when I reflect on myself 5 years ago, I just started ..., I had no idea I'd be here today having this interview with ...

        > I don't know how to predict the future, but I can tell you my future plans. (In the short run, ..., in the long run, ...)

        > One thing is always clear, that is growth. I mean, if you look at my life stories in the past, I have been changing roles, companies, industries, and even moving from country to country. Every time I make a decision, I’m always looking for passion, opportunities for growth, opportunities to challenge the status quo, to improve my skills and learn new things. I think this is very important for software developers because technologies are quickly advancing, every year we have new things come out, nothing is set in stone, and we might even need to compete with AI. So I think wherever there are opportunities for growth, for improvement, I will probably be there in 5 years.

    === "B"

        What is your tolerance for ambiguity?

        > I’m very tolerant when it comes to ambiguity, because software is full of compromises. Sometimes it can be hard to strike a balance between performance, robustness, readability and user expectations. I think ambiguity is not necessarily a bad thing, you can choose between multiple solutions, and that gives you a chance to brainstorm, to come up with new ideas.

        > People have different personality and thoughts. Try to be patient, keep calm, understand others perspectives, discuss the solutions, and try to reach an agreement. If the conflict cannot be resolved, learn to compromise. I've learned this many times in life that collaboration is often more important than the solution itself. With great teamwork and mutual respect, any conflict can be resolved with time.
